<H1>About DMail</H1>
<H2>Intro</H2>
<p>Dmail is the default email client for SNU. It is highly customizable, and has compatibility with several other email clients.</p>
<H2>As an acronym</H2>
<p>Dmail stands for:</p>
<p><b>D</b>igital <b>Mail</b></p>
<H2>Revival</H2>
<p>When the idea for Dmail was first created, it was not intended for SNU. It was going to be its own separate project. At the time, I was only working on assets. I didn't have the capability of making it a thing yet.</p>
<p>On March 24th 2019, Sean decided to bring the project to SNU. He went on a hard drive search that took about 20 minutes to get the original assets (over 1 gigabyte in size) throughout the day, minor changes were made, such as an inbox, welcome center, import center, compose center, about page, and import center.</p>
<p>It is still worked on to this day, as of March 24th 2019, not at a frequent rate compared to the rest of the site</p>
<H2>Offline</H2>
<p>One of the benefits of DMail is you have access to your entire inbox when you are online if you load it first. You can compose Emails, but you can't send them. You can also adjust settings</p>
<H2>Connection</H2>
<p>DMail doesn't use that much data, it is slim and powerful. However, when you turn on fancy graphics, and adjust advanced settings, you might need to get something better than 3G to continue running smoothly. If you have 4G, 5G, it will work fine. Let's not forget Wi-Fi, make sure you have at least 450 kbps available for Dmail on your device.</p>
<H2>Grammar usage</H2>
<p>There is a difference between the words "email" and "Dmail" here we will show the correct grammar usage for both words</p>
<p>We didn't intend for people to use the phrase like this "I want to send a dmail" as it sounds weird</p>
<p>We will show you anyway</p>
<p>I would like to send <b>an</b> email</p>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<p>I would like to send <b>a</b> dmail</p>
<p>Send me <b>an</b> email</p>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<p>Send me <b>a</b> dmail</p>
<H2>Vulgar usage [NSFW]</H2>
<p>Unfortunately, this name is very easy to make fun of for the dirty minded. We could have called it SNU mail, but Dmail seemed better, as we can't brand everything as "SNU THIS" and "SNU THAT" it can still be pretty funny though</p>
<p>I will give you another second to figure out why it is dirty...</p>
<p>OK times up, it can also mean dickmail to people who have never heard of it</p>
<H2>Outro</H2>
<p>Thank you for reading about Dmail!</p>
