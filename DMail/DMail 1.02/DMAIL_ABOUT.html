<H1>About DMail</H1>
<H2 id="intro">Intro</H2>
<p>Dmail is the default email client for SNU. It is highly customizable, and has compatibility with several other email clients.</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="acronym">As an acronym</H2>
<p>Dmail stands for:</p>
<p><b>D</b>igital <b>Mail</b></p>
<HR>
<H2 id="revival">Revival</H2>
<p>When the idea for Dmail was first created, it was not intended for SNU. It was going to be its own separate project. At the time, I was only working on assets. I didn't have the capability of making it a thing yet.</p>
<p>On March 24th 2019, Sean decided to bring the project to SNU. He went on a hard drive search that took about 20 minutes to get the original assets (over 1 gigabyte in size) throughout the day, minor changes were made, such as an inbox, welcome center, import center, compose center, about page, and import center.</p>
<p>It is still worked on to this day, as of March 24th 2019, not at a frequent rate compared to the rest of the site</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="offline">Offline</H2>
<p>One of the benefits of DMail is you have access to your entire inbox when you are online if you load it first. You can compose Emails, but you can't send them. You can also adjust settings</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="connection">Connection</H2>
<p>DMail doesn't use that much data, it is slim and powerful. However, when you turn on fancy graphics, and adjust advanced settings, you might need to get something better than 3G to continue running smoothly. If you have 4G, 5G, it will work fine. Let's not forget Wi-Fi, make sure you have at least 450 kbps available for Dmail on your device.</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="grammarUsage">Grammar usage</H2>
<p>There is a difference between the words "email" and "Dmail" here we will show the correct grammar usage for both words</p>
<p>We didn't intend for people to use the phrase like this "I want to send a dmail" as it sounds weird</p>
<p>We will show you anyway</p>
<p>I would like to send <b>an</b> email</p>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<p>I would like to send <b>a</b> dmail</p>
<p>Send me <b>an</b> email</p>
<p><b>OR</b></p>
<p>Send me <b>a</b> dmail</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="Vulgar">Vulgar usage [NSFW]</H2>
<p>Unfortunately, this name is very easy to make fun of for the dirty minded. We could have called it SNU mail, but Dmail seemed better, as we can't brand everything as "SNU THIS" and "SNU THAT" it can still be pretty funny though</p>
<p>I will give you another second to figure out why it is dirty...</p>
<p>OK times up, it can also mean dickmail to people who have never heard of it</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="Rename">Rename</H2>
<p>My mom said that the name wasn't the best and that it sounds weird. I like the name, but I might have to make a change. She is suggesting "digimail" I just looked it up and it has been taken since 2017 and possibly earlier (I didn't do that much research) so I am stuck with the name "Dmail" I could call it SNU mail, but I don't want SNU placed in front of everything. Change is needed sometimes</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="DomainAndAddress">Domain and address</H2>
<p>With Dmail, you get to choose your own custom domain without paying any money (unlike gmail) if you don't choose a domain, you will get an email defaulted either like one of these:</p>
<p><b>newuser@dmail.com</b></p>
<p><b>newuser@dmail.net</b></p>
<p><b>newuser@snumail.com</b></p>
<p><b>newuser@snumail.net</b></p>
<p>Also, your domain for your email can be up to 256 characters before the @ and 32 characters after the @, making your email address max out at 289 characters. Make sure to make it easy to remember or write it down, an address that long is difficult to manage mentally.</p>
<p>You can use special characters in your domain, however, they must be either ANSI, ASCII, UTF-2, UTF-8, UTF-16, or any in between</p>
<HR>
<H2 id="FileSupport">File support</H2>
<p>DMail supports a vast amount of file formats.</p>
<p>Since the file format lists are large and long, and constanrly updating, we are not going to embed them here. You can view them by clicking the hyperlinks</p>
<p><b><a href="ImageFormatSupport.html">Supported image formats</a></b></p>

<p><b><a href="ArchiveFormatSupport.html">Supported archive formats</a></b></p>
<HR>
<H2 id="EmailSizeLimit">Max email size</H2>
<p>Dmail supports VERY large emails. However, we have to put a limit on how big a single email is.</p>
<p>Dmail supports emails up to 2 Gigabytes in size. We don't recommend sending large emails frequently, as your account can run out of space. Someday, when technology improves, we will increase the size limit.</p>
<p>Here are the expected max size limits in the near future:</p>
<HR>
<p><b>Technical note</b></p>
<p><i>(i) Units are in base 10 (KB = 1000 B) NOT Base 2 (KB = 1024 B)</i></p>
<HR>
<p><b>4 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>6 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>8 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>12 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>16 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>20 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>24 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>25 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>32 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>40 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>45 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>50 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>64 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>75 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>85 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>100 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>128 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>150 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>175 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>200 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>256 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>300 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>360 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>440 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>500 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>600 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>750 Gigabytes</b></p>
<p><b>1000 Gigabytes (1 Terabyte)</b></p>
<p><b>1500 Gigabytes (1.5 Terabytes)</b></p>
<p><b>?? ?????????</b></p>
<p>These goals will take a while to reach. However, technology is still getting better, so we are getting there every day.</p>
