DMails are emails sent with the DMail client. DMail stands for:

They can also be called emails, it is just a separate name for them. DMail messages are advanced emails, with the same functionality as normal emails sent with programs such as Outlook, GMail, ProtonMail, etc, except that extra features are added.
